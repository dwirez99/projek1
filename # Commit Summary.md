Implement Orangtua User Account Creation and Management.

This commit introduces automated user account creation for orangtuas (parents) upon their data entry. Usernames are generated from the parent's name, and the initial password defaults to their phone number. The changes also include CRUD functionality for managing Orangtua accounts.

### Changes
- Modified `OrangtuaController.php`: Implemented `store` method to create a user account in the `users` table corresponding to the created `Orangtua` record. The username is a slugified version of the parent's name, and the password is the parent's phone number.  The `update` and `destroy` methods are also updated to reflect the changes to User model.
- Added `database/migrations/2025_05_17_173719_add_userid_to_orangtuas.php`: Migration to add a `user_id` foreign key column to the `orangtuas` table, linking each parent to a user account.
- Added `database/migrations/2025_05_17_190244_add_nickname_to_orangtuas.php`: Migration to add a `nickname` column to the `orangtuas` table.
- Modified `app/Models/Orangtua.php`: Added `nickname` to the fillable array.
- Modified `app/Models/User.php`: Added `orangTua` relationship to the Orangtua model.
- Modified views:
    - Changed view names from `orangtua.*` to `orangtuas.*`.
    - Created `orangtuas/create.blade.php` and `orangtuas/index.blade.php` to manage the Orangtua CRUD functionality.
    - Added `orangtuas/statusgizi.blade.php` to view the status gizi of a parent's children.
- Modified StatusgiziController.php: Added indexOrtu method to retrieve status gizi data for a logged-in parent.
- Updated dependencies in `composer.lock` due to framework and related package updates.

### Impact
- **Behavioral changes**: When a new orangtua record is created via the `OrangtuaController`, a corresponding user account is automatically generated.
- **Dependencies affected**: The `User` model and the `users` table now have a direct relationship with the `Orangtua` model and `orangtuas` table. `spatie/laravel-permission` is used to assign the 'orangtua' role to the created User.
- **Security**: Initial password is set to the parent's phone number, which might need a password change flow.
- Added new route /statusgiziOrtu to display a parent's children's status gizi information.
